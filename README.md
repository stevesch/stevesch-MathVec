# stevesch-MathVec

Provides classes for

  vector2 : 2-element vector

  vector3 : 3-element vector

  vector4 : 4-element vector

  Matrix4 : 4x4 matrix

  Quat: quaternion


Typical operations for 3D rendering are provided for each of the above classes (transformation, projection, etc.).

Use in combination with stevesch-Mesh and stevesch-Display for rendering 3D objects on an SPI TFT screen.
